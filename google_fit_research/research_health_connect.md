  <h1>Research: Transitioning from Google Fit to Health Connect in Flutter</h1>

  <h2>üîç Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    During the development of our AI-based mental health companion app, I initially explored the Google Fit API to retrieve health-related metrics like step count, heart rate, and sleep data. However, I soon discovered that as of May 2024, Google has officially deprecated the Google Fit APIs, making them no longer usable for third-party apps‚Äîincluding Flutter-based projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    This forced a necessary shift in approach, leading me to explore Health Connect, Android‚Äôs new system for managing health data across apps.
  </p>

  <h2>‚ùå Why Google Fit API Is No Longer Usable</h2>
  <p>In 2023, Google confirmed it would phase out Fit APIs in favor of a more unified and privacy-focused health data platform: Health Connect. By May 2024, Fit services were fully shut down, and developers had to migrate their systems.</p>

  <p>Here‚Äôs why Google Fit was deprecated:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Its architecture had become outdated</li>
    <li>It didn‚Äôt fully support newer Android health policies</li>
    <li>Android needed a single, standardized hub for health data sharing across apps</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>‚úÖ Health Connect: The New Standard</h2>
  <p>Health Connect, developed by Android, is now the go-to solution for accessing fitness and wellness data. It serves as a secure and centralized platform where health apps can read and write data‚Äîwith full user control over what‚Äôs shared.</p>

  <p><strong>Key features:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Central access to steps, heart rate, calories, sleep, and more</li>
    <li>Fine-grained user permission system</li>
    <li>Seamless inter-app data sharing while protecting privacy</li>
    <li>Available on Android 10 and above via the Play Store</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For mental health apps like ours, this is a game-changer‚Äîit lets us connect wellness metrics (like sleep or activity) directly with mood and emotion tracking, all through a standardized system.
  </p>

  <h2>üß© Flutter Integration with <code>flutter_health_connect</code></h2>
  <p>To bridge Health Connect with Flutter, I found the <code>flutter_health_connect</code> package. It acts as a wrapper for the native Health Connect API and works well for reading health metrics inside Flutter apps.</p>

  <h2>üõ†Ô∏è How to Integrate Health Connect in Flutter</h2>

  <h3>‚úÖ Step 1: Add the Plugin</h3>
  <p><strong>In <code>pubspec.yaml</code>:</strong></p>
  <pre><code>dependencies:
  flutter_health_connect: ^0.1.3
</code></pre>

  <p><strong>In <code>android/app/build.gradle</code>:</strong></p>
  <pre><code>minSdkVersion 26
</code></pre>

  <h3>‚úÖ Step 2: Request Necessary Permissions</h3>
  <pre><code class="language-dart">final healthConnect = FlutterHealthConnect();
final permissions = [
  HealthPermissionType.steps,
  HealthPermissionType.heartRate,
  HealthPermissionType.sleepSession,
];

final isAvailable = await healthConnect.isAvailable();

if (isAvailable) {
  final granted = await healthConnect.requestPermissions(permissions);
  print("Permissions granted: $granted");
}
</code></pre>

  <h3>‚úÖ Step 3: Read Health Data (e.g., Steps)</h3>
  <pre><code class="language-dart">final steps = await healthConnect.readRecords(
  HealthRecordType.steps,
  startTime: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 1)),
  endTime: DateTime.now(),
);

for (final record in steps) {
  print("Steps: ${record.count}, Time: ${record.startTime}");
}
</code></pre>

  <h2>üì± Real-World Use in Our AI Mental Health App</h2>
  <p>Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm planning to use Health Connect data in our app:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step count</strong> ‚Üí to analyze physical activity vs mood fluctuations</li>
    <li><strong>Heart rate</strong> ‚Üí to detect elevated stress or anxiety levels</li>
    <li><strong>Sleep duration</strong> ‚Üí to correlate with emotional well-being</li>
    <li><strong>User-controlled sharing</strong> ‚Üí ensures ethical and privacy-first AI interactions</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üß† Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    With the discontinuation of Google Fit APIs, Health Connect has become the new standard for accessing health and fitness data on Android. For Flutter developers like us, the <code>flutter_health_connect</code> plugin provides a practical way to integrate these features into wellness apps.
  </p>
  <p>
    This transition not only keeps our app compliant with Android‚Äôs latest ecosystem‚Äîbut also allows us to offer a more intelligent, holistic, and ethical mental health experience to users.
