Research: Transitioning from Google Fit to Health Connect in Flutter
üîç Introduction
During the development of our AI-based mental health companion app, I initially explored the Google Fit API to retrieve health-related metrics like step count, heart rate, and sleep data. However, I soon discovered that as of May 2024, Google has officially deprecated the Google Fit APIs, making them no longer usable for third-party apps‚Äîincluding Flutter-based projects.

This forced a necessary shift in approach, leading me to explore Health Connect, Android‚Äôs new system for managing health data across apps.

‚ùå Why Google Fit API Is No Longer Usable
In 2023, Google confirmed it would phase out Fit APIs in favor of a more unified and privacy-focused health data platform: Health Connect. By May 2024, Fit services were fully shut down, and developers had to migrate their systems.

Here‚Äôs why Google Fit was deprecated:

Its architecture had become outdated

It didn‚Äôt fully support newer Android health policies

Android needed a single, standardized hub for health data sharing across apps

‚úÖ Health Connect: The New Standard
Health Connect, developed by Android, is now the go-to solution for accessing fitness and wellness data. It serves as a secure and centralized platform where health apps can read and write data‚Äîwith full user control over what‚Äôs shared.

Key features:
Central access to steps, heart rate, calories, sleep, and more

Fine-grained user permission system

Seamless inter-app data sharing while protecting privacy

Available on Android 10 and above via the Play Store

For mental health apps like ours, this is a game-changer‚Äîit lets us connect wellness metrics (like sleep or activity) directly with mood and emotion tracking, all through a standardized system.

üß© Flutter Integration with flutter_health_connect
To bridge Health Connect with Flutter, I found the flutter_health_connect package. It acts as a wrapper for the native Health Connect API and works well for reading health metrics inside Flutter apps.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Integrate Health Connect in Flutter
‚úÖ Step 1: Add the plugin
In pubspec.yaml:

yaml
Copy
Edit
dependencies:
  flutter_health_connect: ^0.1.3
In android/app/build.gradle:

gradle
Copy
Edit
minSdkVersion 26
‚úÖ Step 2: Request necessary permissions
dart
Copy
Edit
final healthConnect = FlutterHealthConnect();
final permissions = [
  HealthPermissionType.steps,
  HealthPermissionType.heartRate,
  HealthPermissionType.sleepSession,
];

final isAvailable = await healthConnect.isAvailable();

if (isAvailable) {
  final granted = await healthConnect.requestPermissions(permissions);
  print("Permissions granted: $granted");
}
‚úÖ Step 3: Read health data (e.g., steps)
dart
Copy
Edit
final steps = await healthConnect.readRecords(
  HealthRecordType.steps,
  startTime: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 1)),
  endTime: DateTime.now(),
);

for (final record in steps) {
  print("Steps: ${record.count}, Time: ${record.startTime}");
}
üì± Real-World Use in Our AI Mental Health App
Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm planning to use Health Connect data in our app:

Step count ‚Üí to analyze physical activity vs mood fluctuations

Heart rate ‚Üí to detect elevated stress or anxiety levels

Sleep duration ‚Üí to correlate with emotional well-being

User-controlled sharing ‚Üí ensures ethical and privacy-first AI interactions

üß† Conclusion
With the discontinuation of Google Fit APIs, Health Connect has become the new standard for accessing health and fitness data on Android. For Flutter developers like us, the flutter_health_connect plugin provides a practical way to integrate these features into wellness apps.

This transition not only keeps our app compliant with Android‚Äôs latest ecosystem‚Äîbut also allows us to offer a more intelligent, holistic, and ethical mental health experience to users.
