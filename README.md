  Our project is inspired by research in the field of AI-powered mental health support. We referred to the following paper to understand Gen Z's mental health needs and how conversational AI can play a vital role in mental wellness:

<blockquote>
  <strong>Talk Therapy for GenZ: AI Mental Health Companion</strong><br>
  N. Tyagi, S. Jha, A. Shukla and R. Singh, 2023 International Conference on Computational Performance Evaluation (ComPE), Shillong, India.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>
  While the referenced paper implements a basic AI chatbot using rule-based logic and traditional NLP techniques, we have extended the concept by integrating a more advanced stack â€” leveraging <strong>BERT</strong> for context-aware natural language understanding and <strong>Google Gemini API</strong> for real-time AI interaction. This enhances the overall intelligence, empathy, and personalization of the mental health companion tailored for Gen Z.
