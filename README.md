<h2>🌐 Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
Mental health concerns among Gen Z are rising at an alarming rate. Emotional volatility, social media stress, and lack of accessible support make it difficult for students and young individuals to find help. Our goal was to create an <strong>AI Mental Health Companion</strong> — a smart, conversational application that can not only detect emotional distress but also recommend real-time solutions, coping mechanisms, and direct support when needed.
