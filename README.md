  Our project is inspired by research in the field of AI-powered mental health support. We referred to the following paper to understand Gen Z's mental health needs and how conversational AI can play a vital role in mental wellness:

<blockquote>
  <strong>Talk Therapy for GenZ: AI Mental Health Companion</strong><br>
  N. Tyagi, S. Jha, A. Shukla and R. Singh, 2023 International Conference on Computational Performance Evaluation (ComPE), Shillong, India.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>
  While the referenced paper implements a basic AI chatbot using rule-based logic and traditional NLP techniques, we have extended the concept by integrating a more advanced stack ‚Äî leveraging <strong>BERT</strong> for context-aware natural language understanding and <strong>Google Gemini API</strong> for real-time AI interaction. This enhances the overall intelligence, empathy, and personalization of the mental health companion tailored for Gen Z.

<h1>üìò Research Reference: Mental Health Study on Gen Z</h1>

<h2>üìù Paper Title:</h2>
<p><strong>Self-Esteem, Coping Strategies, and Anxiety Among Generation Z: A Correlational Study</strong><br>
<strong>Author:</strong> Chatla Shizy Raja Kumari<br>
<strong>Journal:</strong> Global Research Journal of Social Sciences and Management, 2024<br>
<strong>DOI:</strong> <a href="https://doi.org/10.55306/GRJSSM.2024.2101" target="_blank">10.55306/GRJSSM.2024.2101</a></p>

<h2>üìö What the Paper Tells Us:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Trait Anxiety, Self-Esteem, and Coping Strategies</strong> are deeply interrelated among Generation Z.</li>
  <li><strong>High trait anxiety</strong> is negatively correlated with <strong>self-esteem</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Problem-focused coping strategies</strong> (actively solving issues) are positively associated with higher self-esteem.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoidant coping</strong> (ignoring problems or denying them) is linked with lower self-esteem.</li>
  <li><strong>Emotion-focused coping</strong> did not show a significant impact on self-esteem in this study.</li>
  <li><strong>Females</strong> showed higher trait anxiety levels than males, suggesting gender-based mental health patterns.</li>
  <li>The study used standard psychological tools:
    <ul>
      <li>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)</li>
      <li>Brief COPE Scale</li>
      <li>Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>üéì What We Learned from This Paper:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Building <strong>self-esteem</strong> and encouraging <strong>problem-solving behavior</strong> can reduce anxiety levels in Gen Z.</li>
  <li>Not all coping methods are equally effective‚Äî<strong>adaptive coping</strong> (problem-focused) is healthier than avoidant coping.</li>
  <li>Mental health interventions should <strong>focus on boosting confidence</strong> and <strong>reducing negative self-perception</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Gender-sensitive approaches</strong> may be needed to better support female users who tend to report higher anxiety.</li>
  <li>This research helped us shape our solution by focusing on:
    <ul>
      <li>Promoting resilience through structured coping support</li>
      <li>Reducing avoidant behavior</li>
      <li>Supporting youth mental health with scientifically backed methods</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
